# About Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter template bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), the template uses [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) design framework and it is preconfigured with a unit test using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme.js](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/installation/)

## Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to configure unit testing tools like jest or mocha.

They are preconfigured so that you can focus on the code.

Just clone the repo, and follow the getting started section then you’re good to go.
